## SEBF
[SEBF](https://github.com/sebf2020/ijcai20/blob/master/sebf.md) describe the interplay among the parties in the framework. [Overall system operation diagram](https://github.com/sebf2020/ijcai20/blob/master/Overall%20system%20operation%20diagram.png) illustrates the unified modeling language (UML) figure of our SEBF model.

## Code
This [Code](https://github.com/sebf2020/ijcai20/tree/master/src) is a demo of the project, which main purpose is to show the principle of connectivity between blockchain and Oracle. We are sorting out more codes. After sorting out, we will upload the complete project codes to the current webpage for updating

## Demo video
This [video](https://sites.google.com/view/sebf/) shows the use of postman to test the SEBF model's blockchain in the local environment. Another experiment shows how SEBF model performs in an actual financial blockchain environment.
