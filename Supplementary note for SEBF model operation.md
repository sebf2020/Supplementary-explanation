SEBF operation process

Figure 1 illustrates the unified modeling language (UML) figure generated by our SEBF model. Firstly, user submits the financial service that are needed to be handled or queried with the financial terminal. In the same time, the user needs to submit their signed authentication. The financial terminal preliminarily verifies identity of the user and returns the verification result to the user. If the identity of the user is successfully verified, the terminal will send the signed <T-TYPE> template data message to the blockchain node. When the message is received, the node will verify the signature of user and check whether the type of the data is <Token>. Here, <Token> is the token circulated on the financial blockchain, which can be regarded as a kind of simple template data during transfer transaction. The built-in <Token> template type is solidified in blockchain, and the data with this type can be directly ran by blockchain node. If the type of the data is <Token>, the data is stored in local <Token> sub-tree collection. Here, <Token> sub-tree is a Merkle tree that specially records the data of <Token>, and broadcasts this message to other nodes. On the other hand, if the type of the data is not <Token>, the node will send the data to oracle machine in the oracle group. In our model, oracle machine is considered as a source of reliable data. When the oracle machine receives the message, it will conduct smart contract and judge whether the type of message has been authenticated by the financial regulator agency. If the message is successfully verified, the oracle machine will sign the message, and return the message to blockchain node. The node will store the data into the corresponding sub-tree collection, and broadcast the message in the blockchain network. After an epoch, the nodes will mine a new block. The financial terminal will calculate the hash value according to the submitted data, perform simplified payment verification (SPV), and return the SPV result to the user.
