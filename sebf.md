                          Supplementary explanation of the overall operation process of the SEBF model

As shown in Fig. R1, firstly, the user selects the financial services that he wants to query/process on the financial terminal. In the same time, the user needs to submit his signed authentication. The financial terminal preliminarily verifies the identity of the user and returns the verification result to the user. If the identity of the user is successfully verified, the terminal will then send the signed #T-TYPE# template data message to the blockchain node. When the message is received, the node will verify the signature of the user and check whether the type of the data is #Token#. Here, #Token# is the token circulated on the financial blockchain, which can be regarded as a kind of simple template data during transfer transaction. The built-in #Token# template type is solidified in blockchain, and the data with this type can be directly run by blockchain node. For example, the built-in #Token# template data type records the basic transfer transactions in the blockchain. If the type of the data is #Token#, the data is stored in local #Token# sub-tree collection. Here, #Token# sub-tree is a Merkle tree that specially records the data of #Token#. The node will broadcast this message to other nodes. If the type of the data is not #Token# (for example, the template data types do not record the basic transfer transactions, and they are Insurance, CrossborderPayment, or ElectronicIdentity, which record healthy financial insurance data, cross-border transfer transaction data, or the userâ€™s electronic ID information data), the node will send the data to oracle machine in the oracle group. When the oracle machine receives the message, it will conduct a smart contract and judge whether the type of message has been authenticated by the financial regulator agency, i.e., the authoritative institutions like bank, the insurance company, and securities and exchange commission. If the message is successfully verified, the oracle machine will sign the message, and return the message to the blockchain node. The node will store the data into the corresponding sub-tree collection, and broadcast the message in the blockchain network. After an epoch, the nodes will mine a new block. The financial terminal will calculate the hash value according to the submitted data, perform simplified payment verification (SPV), and return the SPV result to the user.
